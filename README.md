# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project I have used the dataset from kaggle to build different classification models, i.e. Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM etc. to predict the credit card fraud detection. I have used Principle Component Analysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction. I have tuned the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
